            In our Soilmate Plants store, we have many species of plants that are most often purchased by our customers. The more exotic ones are brought from the greenhouse only after we know that they will go to a new home. The journey of plants from the greenhouse to our Transplanting Point takes one day. Then they spend another day there under our care, when we transplant them to appropriate soil and larger pots, wash and prepare them. If you are from Berlin, the plants will usually arrive to you on the 3rd day after leaving the greenhouse, if you order the plants with courier delivery, they will be at your door on the 6th-7th. day after leaving the greenhouse - always in perfect shape. The time it takes for the plant to reach your home is 3-7 days.

            We carefully check the plants that come to us from the greenhouse to ensure that they reach you in perfect condition and health.
            If the plant is to be replanted, we select the appropriate pot size and appropriate substrate.
            We always pour a layer of expanded clay at the bottom. This is drainage that gives the roots room to breathe and prevents water from standing in the pot. Expanded clay is resistant to mold and fungi, so it prevents root rot.
            When replanting, we also look at the roots - it is important that they are healthy. We are careful not to damage the roots, so we transplant the plants with the greatest care.

            The plants are delivered to your homes in Berlin the next day! To the rest of Germany just after the weekend - we ship on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The pots are stable and the entire transport is safe.
            The pot is placed in a thick cardboard insert: inside there is an ecological filler that protects the pot during shocks, and around it there is cardboard that prevents breakage.
            On colder days, we additionally dress the plants in agrotextile clothes so that they reach you safe and sound.
            Instructions and advice
            We attach a care manual to each plant, where you will find all the necessary information and advice. We are always happy to answer questions and help.
