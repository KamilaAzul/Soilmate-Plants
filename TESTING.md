## Code Validation
The code on the Soilmate Plants site has been tested through W3C Markup Validation Service, W3C CSS Validation Service, CI Python Linter and JSHint.

### Markup Validation
 Errors were at first found on the site in the W3C Markup Validation Service but could quite easily be fixed (see bugs section). After fixing the inital errors that W3C Markup Validation Service reported, no errors were returned except 1 connected to a form on the profile page (more information about that in the bugs section).

### Lighthouse
Google Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to test the site within the areas of *Performance*, *Accessibility*, *Best Practices* and *SEO*. I tested the *home page*, *view all blog posts page*, *view all products page*, *product management page* and *blog management page*. The testing showed the following:

* Home Page - Performance: 70, Accessibility: 100, Best Practises: 100, SEO: 92
* View All Blog Posts Page - Performance: 68, Accessibility: 100, Best Practises: 100, SEO: 92
* View All Products Page - Performance: 64, Accessibility: 99, Best Practises: 100, SEO: 92
* Product Management - Performance: 75, Accessibility: 100, Best Practises: 100, SEO: 100
* Blog Management - Performance: 75, Accessibility: 100, Best Practises: 100, SEO: 100

From a general point of view these are quite good results. On all pages the performance is a little bit to low and it is mainly connected to the image sizes. I did some compressing on all the images(approx -50% in size) but still the performance result landed around 70-80. The decrease in the SEO results are mainly connected to the 'read more' links that is not a optimal description from a SEO point of view. In the view all products page the SEO result is affected by the heading elements not being in sequentially-descending order, but this is an active design choice and not a big issue (but I thought it would be proper to highlight it here so that it's clear I'm aware of it).

### WAVE
[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to check accessibility. 2 errors were found (1 missing form label and 1 contrast error). The missing form label is connected to the Mailchimp code why I don't want to change anything there. The contrast error is connected to the carousel but when I run the check in other contrast checking software there is no error. So I decided to keep it as it is.

### Peer Review
Additional testing of the site was conducted by people outside of the software development field. Some smaller spelling and grammar errors were found on the site and corrected. No major challenges connected to the design or handling of the site.

## Known bugs
No known bugs besides those in the fixed / unfixed bugs section.

### Fixed Bugs
**2022-11-10**
* Bug: When trying to log in to the site locally a CSRF verification failed appears. This fail was connected to CSRF Trusted Origins which could be fixed by adding a row to settings.py. It is a little bit of a hassle to change the address from time to time due to that the local adress changes.

* Bug: I got an Uncaught TypeError connected to the toast messages. This hade to do with me using a newer version of Bootstrap which could be easily fixed.

**2022-11-11**
* Bug: I got quite a lot of problems when I deployed the site to Heroku the first time. I got a 'failed to build backports.zoneinfo'. It was actually quite an easy fix. I added a runtime.txt to the root folder with information about what python version Heroku should install to work with the Heroku version at the time.

**2022-11-14**
* Bug: My mentor noticed that it was possible to add a negative number in the price field when adding a product in the product management area. I fixed this by adding a validation check in the product model (MinValueValidator).

* Bug: The CSS Validation reported an error that is connected to Bootstrap. When I validate my own CSS code there are no errors at all. So this might be a Font Awesome bug that is out of my control. But I thought it would be proper to highlight the error here in the bugs section.

* Bug: The HTML Validation reported some errors that could be quite easily fixed.

* Bug: When creating a new product and adding a price more than 999.999.99 EUR the site crasches during checkout (throws a 500 error / InvalidRequestError). This bug was fixed by changing the number of accepted digits in the products model. **Update** The problem did show up again during the handshake with Stripe. I have solved this to lower the number of accepted digits, which works fine for the products on this site.

### Unfixed Bugs

**2022-11-10**
* Bug: The Pagination on the site works really well except when the user chooses a specific category or a specific sorting. The problem is when the user clicks the next/previous button on the pagination the category/sorting attribute disappears which means that the next/previous pagination page does not take the users choice into consideration. I managed to fix parts of the problem and had two sessions with two different tutors without success. I tried to solve the problem by adding if statements in the url to keep the category/sorting but it quite fast got really complex. Me and the tutors discussed if it could be easier to handle it from the product views but I needed to move on with the project to not get stuck on this issue to long. The pagination works as it should with the exception when the user chooses category/sorting. Here is an example of the code that partly worked (which I removed in the deployed project. **2022-11-17** *Update: Since this bug was noticed I have added a view all blog posts (and possibility for the user to view all blog posts with a specific category). This means that the pagination bug is fixed on the view all blog posts template.* **2022-11-18** *Update: I have now fixed one bug connected to the list all products-view, the pagination now takes category into consideration if the uses chooses to filter the products on category.*
```
{% if product_list.has_next %}
<li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="
        {% if current_sorting == 'None_None' %}?page={{ product_list.next_page_number }}
        {% elif current_sorting == 'None_None' and current_categories %}?page={{ product_list.next_page_number }}&category={{ category }}
        {% elif search_term %}?page={{ product_list.next_page_number }}??page={{ product_list.next_page_number }}&q= {{ search_term }}
        {% elif current_sorting %}?page={{ product_list.next_page_number }}&sort={{ sort }}&direction={{ direction }}
        {% elif current_sorting %}?page={{ product_list.next_page_number }}&sort={{ sort }}&direction={{ direction }}
        {% else %}?page={{ product_list.next_page_number }}
        {% endif %}">Next</a>
</li>
```

* Bug: In the checkout form it is possible for the user to add ordinary letters in the phone number field. I have done some digging and it could be possible to use a validator but I haven't gotten it to work fully. I need to prioritize the rest of the project for now, why this bug is unfixed for now.
* Bug: In the checkout form it is possible for the user to add numerals in the name field. I have done some digging and it could be possible to use a validator but I haven't gotten it to work fully. I need to prioritize the rest of the project for now, why this bug is unfixed for now.

**2022-11-17**
* Bug: The HTML Validator Error connected to the Profile Page has not been corrected yet. I haven't been able to correct it without risking to break the rest of the page. The error is connected to the attribute placeholder not allowed on the select element. The form code for this section is based on the 'Boutique Ado' project with quite complex looping through the form fields. So for now I will not fix it due to the need to prioritize the rest of the project but of course if I would use the site in a live situation I would fix it. Actually if I could do the form again I would not use a loop functionality due to **unnecessary** added complexity.

**2022-11-18**
* Bug: On the add_product.html (Product Management) page the drop-down arrow on the size field is missing. I have tried several fixes without success so I decided to keep it as it is. If the site would have gone live I would have invested more time to fix the bug.

**2022-11-22**
* Bug: After adding a product from the product management view without a size and then change the product to include a size the site crasches (TypeError). This is not something I can't prioritize to fix it due to project deadline but I thought it would be proper to report it as a bug so that you know I am aware of it.

**2022-11-22**
* Bug: If a user has added an item in the wishlist and admin changes the product to draft the product still is showing in the users wishlist. If admin removes the product it disappears from the users wishlist. It's quite easy to put in a check if the product is in draft or not on the wishlist (hence not show it if it's not published). I can't prioritize this due to project deadline, but I am aware of the bug (which is not a critical bug I would say).
