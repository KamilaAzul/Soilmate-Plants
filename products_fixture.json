Although it has been popular in home cultivation for many years, it is currently experiencing a strong renaissance. In nature, it grows in humid tropical forests and, unlike many ficuses, it does not develop aerial or supporting roots. It impresses primarily with its large leaves with an interesting shape, resembling a lyre. The leaves grow up to 25 cm long, are stiff and slightly leathery to the touch, and their edges are slightly wavy. Although in nature it grows to several meters, in home cultivation you can regulate its growth by trimming the tops of the shoots. Lyreleaf Ficus usually has an upright habit and one main stem.\r\nWait until 3/4 of the soil in the pot dries out before watering again.", "price": "64.05", "rating": "5.00", "image_url": null, "image": "FicusLyrata3.jpg"}}, {"model": "products.product", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Calathea orbifolia", "sku": "Calathea orbifolia", "category": 2, "species_category": null, "care_level": 5, "has_sizes": false, "size": 1, "light": 2, "safty": 1, "description": "Calathea orbifolia is a popular houseplant with large, striped foliage.

In its natural habitat, it can most often be observed in shaded places. However, it should be remembered that in a tropical jungle, despite the shaded place, much more sun reaches it than in our conditions, so it is best to find a place at home with bright, diffused light (e.g. an eastern or western window). Monstera does not tolerate direct, scorching midday sun - it can burn its leaves. In winter, it is worth illuminating the monstera with appropriate light bulbs that will help maintain the vitality of this beautiful plant. This species does not tolerate excess water, so water the plant only when the substrate is completely dry. Light, permeable and fertile soil is best for cultivation.
